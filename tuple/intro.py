# tuple are same as list but there is one main difference i.e. tuple is immutable once you store any data in it you can not add or remove data from Tuple
# it's syntax is=== x=("mohit",1,2.0,"jai shree ram") you can store anything in tuple
# Now's you might doubt why should we use tuple when we have list as well as we can do anything with list as compare to tuple ...................so the answer is tuple is faster than list
# if we know that we don't have to change out data then we should use tuple

# methods which we can use in tuple
# count(item) how many times this item is present in our tuple
# len() to find length of tuple
